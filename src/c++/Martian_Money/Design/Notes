Money is worth a different amount each day, depending on how it was traded the
	previous day.

The bank will trade at a fixed rate, and you can trade with other people at 
	whatever rate the two people agree upon.

The more one particular currency is traded out from the bank, the less it is
	worth.  The more a currency comes into the bank, the more it is worth.
	(Cheap bastards)

The values start randomly seeded.  How?

Each player either gets the exact same starting money, or chooses his or her 
	starting money before values are seeded.

A shop will sell objects for certain exact amount of certain currencies.

Whomever gets a particular random-at-start combination of shop objects wins.

Bank values are based on an arctangent relationship of the amount the bank has
	at the beginning of the day.
